h2 blind w/ first person anims

Free Camera TODO:
implement and test:
h3
od
hr
h4

test coop, mp, theater

current freecam issues:
in-game hud messages (press e to enter etc) still show up (h1, h2)
getting hit still flashes your screen (h2)
pausing game stops IsMouseInput from updatting (h1) -- todo: should be a seperate flag, just scan-test 
10% chance to crash game when enabling free cam (all games)
dying zooms in the cam (h2)

stuff to implement but probably after a first release:
way to change input bindings for camera
automation stuff (anchor to object etc)
velocity-based interpolator (and maintain/set velocity stuff)


3d waypoint system
3d object info overlay
infiniteammo/bottomlessclip ptr data for non-h1 games
skull selection
trigger overlay
sprint meter
free cam





DONE LIST:
Fix ctrl-tab input bringing up imgui thing
h1 rng in displayinfo

Update pointer data to make unit tests pass





Handled unhandled exceptions. Don't cause an issue for me but might for someone else:
* One of my control->MCC-midhook services is having a small heartattack with null values when calling scopedRequests right at init
	* I THINK i've fixed this by adding a half second delay before modal popup begins.
