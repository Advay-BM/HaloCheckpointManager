Create an objectLookup service. this will be used by playerInfo, invulnerability, triggerOverlay etc
	maybe cache results of player lookup
	can just do a playerLookup service to start with? ehhh would be better performance but shite extensibility, so no.

There's like a 5% chance the game crashes when dll injected. Probably render hook installing at same time as a render. Can we thread freeze like safety-hook?

HCMExternal still not re-injecting on re-attach

HCMExternal SaveFolder view needs scrollbar

Speedhack crashes if HCMInternal shutdown ie if hooks disappear. The hooks need to be permanent. Shutdown should just set speed to 1.
I'm not sure if safety-hook can do perma hooks like that. Can we just make them a static var? How do we deal with case of them already existing?
	Is there a way to check for that? Wouldn't work well with dev hot-loading anyway.
Would the simplest solution be to inject a seperate dll that lives in mcc forever? Maybe.. How does HCMInternal com with that? A second RPCClient? 
	Can it import funcs from it if it's a static dll? I think that might be possible actually
