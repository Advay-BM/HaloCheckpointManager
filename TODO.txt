Cleanup:
Settings GetValue should not be used to set value (unreference, make seperate set value method)
Cleanup how GetValue vs GetValueDisplay work and who can use them
resolveDependentCheat macro should take game as arg
formatter pass
compiler warning pass
linter pass


** FIX SHOW OPTIONAL CHEAT FAILURES BUTTON**

Waypoint3D:
	* Add "Waypoint List" label at top of list 
	* Show how many waypoints are filtered by the render filter
	* Add index before each waypoint (pad to 3 char - who's gonna use more than 999 waypoints?)
	* toggle/functionality to offset waypoint render position by camera height when in first person (need a service to measure this lmao)
	* Finish waypoint deserialisation
	* Add camera data for non h1/h2 game
	* Waypoints z depth issues: they just render in order in list when ideally they'd be ordered by distance
	* Setup GUIRequiredServices for rest of waypoint GUI elements








DONE LIST:
Fix ctrl-tab input bringing up imgui thing
h1 rng in displayinfo


backburner (tasks to do eventually):
freeCamera for h3, 0d, hr, h4
freeCamera automation stuff 
freeCamera velocity-based interpolator (and maintain/set velocity stuff)
3d object info overlay
skull selection (or at least just acrophobia toggle)
trigger overlay
sprint meter

Add backup cheats system and internal injection toggle to external
add loading the correct level if possible on inject / change level feature in general
Update pointer data to make unit tests pass





Handled unhandled exceptions. Don't cause an issue for me but might for someone else:
* One of my control->MCC-midhook services is having a small heartattack with null values when calling scopedRequests right at init
	* I THINK i've fixed this by adding a half second delay before modal popup begins.
