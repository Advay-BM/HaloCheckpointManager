                    <Bold>This tool doesn't revert checkpoints for you, only sets your most recent checkpoint.</Bold> You still have to revert it yourself in game (or with the checkpoint trainer). Keep in mind that reverting to a checkpoint from a different level to what you're currently on will crash the game; instead just go to the main menu, load the cp with this tool, then use 'resume' in-game.<LineBreak></LineBreak>
                    
                   
                   You may need to run this tool with admin privileges.   <LineBreak></LineBreak>
                   
                   
                   
                   Backup saves and config.json are stored locally to this tools executable file, so move them together if you want to keep things working. <LineBreak></LineBreak>
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   Make sure you set the correct paths in settings if autodetection failed.  <LineBreak></LineBreak>
                   
                  
                   
                   
                   Also you DON'T need to run the game with EAC disabled for this to work.<LineBreak></LineBreak>
