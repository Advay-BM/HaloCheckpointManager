# HaloCheckpointManager
*Created by Burnt and Scales*

---**Download**---  
From the [Releases page.](https://github.com/Burnt-o/HaloCheckpointManager/releases)  

---**Install**---  
No installation necessary, just extract the zip file somewhere that you have read/write permissions to (so nearly anywhere).  


---**Usage Notes**---  

 You need to run this tool with admin privileges.   

 You need to run MCC with EAC disabled.

 Backup saves and config files are stored locally to this tools executable file, so move them together if you want to keep things working. 
 Make sure you set the correct core folder path for Halo 1 in settings if autodetection failed.

 If MCC recieves an update, the tool will break, but once I fix it the update will be automatic (you won't have to download a new release). 

 Some (rare) MCC updates will break previous checkpoints/saves, and you won't be able to use those old saves in future versions of MCC. 

 If you run into any issues, just ping me on Discord  @**BurntKurisu**#6253
