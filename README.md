# HaloCheckpointManager

---Download---  
From the [Releases page.](https://github.com/Burnt-o/HaloCheckpointManager/releases)  

---Install---  
No installation necessary, just extract the zip file somewhere that you have read/write permissions to (so nearly anywhere).  


---Usage Notes:---  
Make sure you set the correct paths in settings if autodetection failed.  

You may need to run this tool with admin privileges.   
         
Backup saves and config.json are stored locally to this tools executable file, so move them together if you want to keep things working. 
                   
Remember to click the refresh button after getting an in-game save to update it in the tool, if you want to be able to back it up.
                   
This tool doesn't revert checkpoints for you, only sets your most recent checkpoint. You still have to revert it yourself in game (or with the checkpoint trainer). Keep in mind that reverting to a checkpoint from a different level to what you're currently on will crash the game; instead just go to the main menu, load the cp with this tool, then use 'resume' in-game.
                   
Also you DON'T need to run the game with EAC disabled for this to work.
