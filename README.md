# HaloCheckpointManager
*A practice tool for Halo: The Master Chief Collection*

---**Download**---  
From the [Releases page.](https://github.com/Burnt-o/HaloCheckpointManager/releases)  

---**Install**---  
No installation necessary, just extract the zip file somewhere that you have read/write permissions to (so nearly anywhere).  


---**Usage Notes**---  

 You need to run this tool with admin privileges.   

 You need to run MCC with EAC disabled.
 
 If MCC crashes every time you try to run HCM, try the "Disable Overlay" option in the HCM Settings tab.

 Backup saves and config files are stored locally to this tools executable file, so move them together if you want to keep things working. 

 If MCC recieves an update, the tool will break, but once I fix it the update will be automatic (you won't have to download a new release, usually anyway). 

 Some (rare) MCC updates will break previous checkpoints/saves, and you won't be able to use those old saves in future versions of MCC. 

 If you run into any issues, just ping me on Discord!  @**BurntKurisu**#6253
